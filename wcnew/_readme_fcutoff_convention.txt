following old tradition:


fcutoff for leakfit is always 2000 (not very sensitive to fcutoff)
fcutoff for compute CDI is always 400 (not very sensitive to fcutoff)


fcutoff for Qtail is 0 (no filter at all!) (result is sensitive to fcutoff)


fcutoff for replotCDI is the fcutoff used showed in HFmain (default should be 400)

fcutoff for jetPlotRun is the fcutoff used showed in HFmain
